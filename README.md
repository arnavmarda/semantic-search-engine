# Semantic Search Engine

This package provides a smarter (albeit slower) way to search for information on the internet. It currently supports searching on Google, Bing, Github and Stackexchange. The search results are ranked based on their semantic similarity to the search query. 

## Installation

The only installation supported as of now is through github. You can install the package by cloning into it and then setting up the development environment. To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone 
```
